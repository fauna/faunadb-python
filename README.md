# faunadb-python

Python client for [FaunaDB](https://faunadb.com).

Documentation is [here](https://faunadb.readthedocs.org/en/latest/).

See the [FaunaDB Documentation](https://faunadb.com/documentation) for
a complete API reference, or look in
[`/tests`](https://github.com/faunadb/faunadb-python/tree/master/tests) for more
examples.


## Building it yourself

### Setup

Python 2:

    virtualenv venv
    source venv/bin/activate

Python 3:

    python3 -m venv venv3
    source venv3/bin/activate

Both (after `source`):

    pip install -e .

### Testing

To run the tests you must have a FaunaDB database available.
Then set the environment variable `FAUNA_ROOT_KEY` to your database's root key.
If you use FaunaDB cloud, this is the password you log in with.

Then run `pip install pynt nose testfixtures`, then `pynt test`.
To test a single test, use e.g. `nosetests tests/client_test.py:ClientTest.test_ping`.

### Documenting

Run `pip install pynt sphinx sphinx_rtd_theme`, then `pynt document`, then open `docs/_build/html/index.html` in a web browser.

### Linting

Run `pip install pylint`, then `pynt lint`.
