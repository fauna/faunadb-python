Python driver for `FaunaDB <https://fauna.com>`_.


Installation
------------

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install faunadb


Compatibility
-------------

The following versions of Python are supported:

* Python 2.7
* Python 3.3
* Python 3.4
* Python 3.5
* Python 3.6


Documentation
-------------

Driver documentation is available at https://faunadb.readthedocs.org/en/latest/.

See the `FaunaDB Documentation <https://fauna.com/documentation>`_ for a complete API reference, or look in `tests`_
for more examples.


Basic Usage
-----------

The first step for any program is to create a ``client`` instance.
This object must be explicitly threaded through any code that needs to access FaunaDB.

FaunaDB can be used directly using the ``query`` API.

Optionally, :doc:`model/model` allows database instances to be represented as objects rather than as dicts.


Building it yourself
--------------------


Setup
~~~~~

.. code-block:: bash

    $ virtualenv venv
    $ source venv/bin/activate
    $ pip install .


Testing
~~~~~~~

To run the tests you must have a FaunaDB database available.
Then set the environment variable ``FAUNA_ROOT_KEY`` to your database's root key.
If you use FaunaDB cloud, this is the password you log in with.

Then run ``make test``.
To test a single test, use e.g. ``python -m unittest tests.test_client.ClientTest.test_ping``.


Coverage
~~~~~~~~

To run the tests with coverage, install the coverage dependencies with ``pip install .[coverage]``,
and then run ``make coverage``. A summary will be displayed to the terminal, and a detailed coverage report
will be available at ``htmlcov/index.html``.


Documenting
~~~~~~~~~~~

Run ``pip install .[doc]`` to install the needed packages to generate the docs.
Then run ``make doc``, then open ``docs/_build/html/index.html`` in a web browser.
